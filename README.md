This is a mod for the PC game, Balatro. Its purpose is to level up the poker hands the more they are used. Since getting planet cards to level them up is very random in the vanilla game, I wanted to add some options for making leveling up more consistent, as I feel this would naturally make the game more consistent.

In the mod's configuration options, you can choose how many times a hand must be played before it levels up. If you check the "Exponential" option, the required number of hands will increase by 1 every time a level-up is earned through this mod.

To install, simply download the folder and place it in the mods folder. For Windows this should be at: C:\Users\(Username Here)\AppData\Roaming\Balatro\Mods\
